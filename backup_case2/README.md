# Case 2 - Mongoose ODM Applications

In this case, we got 4 applications as example and we had to choose 2, then create a database for each application where we can have the required collections to show the content in the examples [Info_here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZmlyL_rWlJnnAshhJODWeffK4sP7Jo9w6vRx5ScWwf0/edit?usp=sharing)

Everything is developed in Typescript using [Moongose_ODM](https://mongoosejs.com/) and here we have the steps to create it in case of other use cases or evaluation purposes. 

## Installation:

1- Install docker and install Mongo image as I show here:
    
    For Docker:
        //Steps here
___
    For Mongo Image:
        //Steps here

2- Create 2 databases, one per application selected, commands are the following:
    
    For database 1:
        //Commands here
___
    For database 2:
        //Commmands here

## Usage:

3- Insert 3 registries in each database. Commands are the following:
    
    For database 1:
        //Commands here
---
    For database 2:
        //Commmands here


4- Create 3 queries as following:

    a) Find All elements:
        For database 1:
            //Commands here

        For database 2:
            //Commmands here
___
    b) "WHERE" with ranges:
        For database 1:
            //Commands here

        For database 2:
            //Commmands here
___
    c) An aggregarated function (avg, min, max):
        For database 1:
            //Commands here

        For database 2:
            //Commmands here
